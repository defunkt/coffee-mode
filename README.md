CoffeeScript Major Mode
=======================

An Emacs major mode for [CoffeeScript][cs], unfancy JavaScript.

Provides syntax highlighting, indentation support, imenu support,
a menu bar, and a few cute commands.

## Installation

In your shell:

    $ cd ~/.emacs.d/vendor
    $ git clone git://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode.git

In your emacs config:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/coffee-mode")
    (require 'coffee-mode)

If `coffee-mode` is not enabled automatically for any files ending in
".coffee" or named "Cakefile", add this to your emacs config as well:

    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.coffee$" . coffee-mode))
    (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("Cakefile" . coffee-mode))

## Indentation

### Configuring

Lines are indented according to the `tab-width` variable. If you're
like me, you probably have this set in your Emacs config globally:

    (setq-default tab-width 4)

Well, idiomatic CoffeeScript uses two spaces. We can set our
`tab-width` to two for `coffee-mode` using the `coffee-mode-hook`:

    (defun coffee-custom ()
      "coffee-mode-hook"
     (set (make-local-variable 'tab-width) 2))

    (add-hook 'coffee-mode-hook
      '(lambda() (coffee-custom)))

For more configuration options and another example of this hook, look
further down in this README.

### TAB Theory

It goes like this: when you press `TAB`, we indent the line unless
doing so would make the current line more than two indentation levels
deepers than the previous line. If that's the case, remove all
indentation.

Consider this code, with point at the position indicated by the
caret:

    line1()
      line2()
      line3()
         ^

Pressing `TAB` will produce the following code:

    line1()
      line2()
        line3()
           ^

Pressing `TAB` again will produce this code:

    line1()
      line2()
    line3()
       ^

And so on. I think this is a pretty good way of getting decent
indentation with a whitespace-sensitive language.

### Newline and Indent

We all love hitting `RET` and having the next line indented
properly. Given this code and cursor position:

    line1()
      line2()
      line3()
            ^

Pressing `RET` would insert a newline and place our cursor at the
following position:

    line1()
      line2()
      line3()

      ^

In other words, the level of indentation is maintained. This
applies to comments as well. Combined with the `TAB` you should be
able to get things where you want them pretty easily.

### Indenters

`class`, `for`, `if`, and possibly other keywords cause the next line
to be indented a level deeper automatically.

For example, given this code and cursor position::

    class Animal
                ^

Pressing enter would produce the following:

    class Animal

      ^

That is, indented a column deeper.

This also applies to lines ending in `->`, `=>`, `{`, `[`, and
possibly more characters.

So this code and cursor position:

    $('#demo').click ->
                       ^

On enter would produce this:

    $('#demo').click ->

      ^

Pretty slick.

## imenu

If you're using imenu, `coffee-mode` should work just fine. This
means users of [textmate.el][tm] will find that `⇧⌘T`
(`textmate-go-to-symbol`) mostly works as expected.

If you're not using imenu check out [this page][im] or textmate.el for
a really awesome way to jump quickly to a function's definition in a
file.

## Commands

If you have `easymenu` you can get to any of these commands from the
menu bar:

![coffee-mode menu bar](http://img.skitch.com/20100308-tt5yn51h2jww2pmjqaawed6eq8.png)

### coffee-compile-file

Compiles the current file as a JavaScript file. Doesn't open it or
anything special for you.

Operating on "basic.coffee" and running this command will save a
"basic.js" in the same directory. Subsequent runs will overwrite the
file.

If there are compilation errors and we the compiler have returned a
line number to us for the first error, the point is moved to that
line, so you can investigate.  If this annoys you, you can set
`coffee-compile-jump-to-error` to `nil`.

### coffee-compile-buffer

Compiles the current buffer to JavaScript using the command specified
by the `coffee-command` variable and opens the contents in a new
buffer using your JavaScript mode of choice. The JavaScript mode is
determined by the `coffee-js-mode` variable and defaults to `js2-mode`.

Bind it:

    (define-key coffee-mode-map [(meta r)] 'coffee-compile-buffer)

### coffee-compile-region

Compiles the selected region to JavaScript using the same
configuration variables as `coffee-compile-buffer`.

Bind it:

    (define-key coffee-mode-map [(meta R)] 'coffee-compile-region)

### Compile-on-save

Hitting the key sequence `C-c C-o C-s` turns on (toggles) the
compile-on-save minor mode in `coffee-mode`.  To enable it by default:

    (add-hook 'coffee-mode-hook '(lambda () (coffee-cos-mode t)))

To enable it only if it looks like you may want to:

    (add-hook 'coffee-mode-hook '(lambda ()
                                   (and (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name))
                                        (file-exists-p (coffee-compiled-file-name))
                                        (coffee-cos-mode t))))

### coffee-repl

Starts a repl in a new buffer using `coffee-command`.

## Hooks

### coffee-mode-hook

Naturally. Example:

    (defun coffee-custom ()
      "coffee-mode-hook"

      ;; CoffeeScript uses two spaces.
      (set (make-local-variable 'tab-width) 2)

      ;; If you don't have js2-mode
      (setq coffee-js-mode 'javascript-mode)

      ;; If you don't want your compiled files to be wrapped
      (setq coffee-args-compile '("-c" "--bare"))

      ;; *Messages* spam
      (setq coffee-debug-mode t)

      ;; Emacs key binding
      (define-key coffee-mode-map [(meta r)] 'coffee-compile-buffer)

      ;; Riding edge.
      (setq coffee-command "~/dev/coffee"))

      ;; Compile '.coffee' files on every save
      (and (file-exists-p (buffer-file-name))
           (file-exists-p (coffee-compiled-file-name))
           (coffee-cos-mode t))))

    (add-hook 'coffee-mode-hook 'coffee-custom))

## Configuration

You can customize any of the following options using `M-x
customize-group` with "coffee" as the group.

You can also customize then with `coffee-mode-hook`, as demonstrated
above.

### coffee-debug-mode

Whether to run in debug mode or not. Logs to `*Messages*`.

Default: `t`

### coffee-js-mode

The mode to use when viewing compiled JavaScript.

Default: `'js2-mode`

### coffee-cleanup-whitespace

Should we `delete-trailing-whitespace' on save? Probably.

Default: `t`

### coffee-tab-width

The tab width to use when indenting.

Default: `tab-width`

### coffee-command

The CoffeeScript command used for evaluating code. Must be in your
path.

Default: `"coffee"`

### coffee-args-repl

The command line arguments to pass to `coffee-command' to start a
REPL.

Default: `'("-i")`

### coffee-args-compile

The command line arguments to pass to `coffee-command' when compiling a file.

Default: `'("-c")`

### coffee-compiled-buffer-name

The name of the scratch buffer used when compiling CoffeeScript.

Default: `"*coffee-compiled*"`

### coffee-compile-jump-to-error

Whether to jump to the first error if compilation fails.  Please note
that the coffee compiler doesn't always give a line number for the
issue and in that case it is not possible to jump to the error, of
course.

Default: `t`

## Bugs

Prototype accessor assignments like `String::length: -> 10` don't look
great.

It's tested on Aquamacs 1.9 (Emacs 22) for OS X Snow Leopard so it may
not work on your environment. Please file a bug at
<http://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode/issues> and maybe we can fix
the problem.

This is the author's first major mode, so there are probably more
bugs.
