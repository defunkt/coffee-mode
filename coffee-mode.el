;;; Commentary

;; Provides syntax highlighting, indentation support, imenu support,
;; a menu bar, and a few cute commands.

;; ## Indentation

;; ### TAB Theory

;; It goes like this: when you press `TAB`, we indent the line unless
;; doing so would make the current line more than two indentation levels
;; deepers than the previous line. If that's the case, remove all
;; indentation.

;; Consider this code, with point at the position indicated by the
;; caret:

;;     line1()
;;       line2()
;;       line3()
;;          ^

;; Pressing `TAB` will produce the following code:

;;     line1()
;;       line2()
;;         line3()
;;            ^

;; Pressing `TAB` again will produce this code:

;;     line1()
;;       line2()
;;     line3()
;;        ^

;; And so on. I think this is a pretty good way of getting decent
;; indentation with a whitespace-sensitive language.

;; ### Newline and Indent

;; We all love hitting `RET` and having the next line indented
;; properly. Given this code and cursor position:

;;     line1()
;;       line2()
;;       line3()
;;             ^

;; Pressing `RET` would insert a newline and place our cursor at the
;; following position:

;;     line1()
;;       line2()
;;       line3()

;;       ^

;; In other words, the level of indentation is maintained. This
;; applies to comments as well. Combined with the `TAB` you should be
;; able to get things where you want them pretty easily.

;; ### Indenters

;; `class`, `for`, `if`, and possibly other keywords cause the next line
;; to be indented a level deeper automatically.

;; For example, given this code and cursor position::

;;     class Animal
;;                 ^

;; Pressing enter would produce the following:

;;     class Animal

;;       ^

;; That is, indented a column deeper.

;; This also applies to lines ending in `->`, `=>`, `{`, `[`, and
;; possibly more characters.

;; So this code and cursor position:

;;     $('#demo').click ->
;;                        ^

;; On enter would produce this:

;;     $('#demo').click ->

;;       ^

;; Pretty slick.

;; Thanks to Jeremy Ashkenas for CoffeeScript, and to
;; http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp_syntax_coloring.html, Jason
;; Blevins's markdown-mode.el and Steve Yegge's js2-mode for guidance.

;; TODO:
;; - Make prototype accessor assignments like `String::length: -> 10` pretty.
;; - mirror-mode - close brackets and parens automatically
