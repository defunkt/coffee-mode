;;; Thanks

;; Major thanks to http://xahlee.org/emacs/elisp_syntax_coloring.html
;; the instructions.

;; Also thanks to Jason Blevins's markdown-mode.el and Steve Yegge's
;; js2-mode for guidance.

;;

;;
;; minus: (x, y) -> x - y
;; String::length: -> 10
;; block: ->
;;   print('potion')
;;
;; Next we look for any line that starts with `class' or
;; `coffee-assign-regexp' followed by `{` and drop into a
;; namespace. This means we search one indentation level deeper for
;; more assignments and add them to the alist prefixed with the
;; namespace name.
